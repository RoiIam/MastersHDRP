## Results
### We have created material with different glinty methods for Unity 2022.1 with HDRP 13.1.x.
- The material can be downloaded [link](https://github.com/RoiIam/MastersHDRP/releases/latest) + attachment: manual([link](https://github.com/RoiIam/MastersHDRP/blob/master/~docs/final/dpRKShaderIntegration.pdf))  for material integration and setup of Unity
- 
#### We created our own glinty method - an extension of the Beibei Wang and Huv Bowles methods.
#### We created an interactive application ([link](https://github.com/RoiIam/MastersHDRP/releases/latest)) to compare 4 known methods and our method + manual ([link](https://github.com/RoiIam/MastersHDRP/blob/master/~docs/final/dpRKAppManual.pdf)) 
#### We evaluated each method from a visual and performance perspective
