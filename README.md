Title: Scalable procedural algorithm for glinty surface rendering in real-time
2023-2024 FMFI Masters Thesis Glints in HDRP

#### Our goal is to create realistic looking glinty material in Unity's HDRP framework.


### In the 2023 Summer semester, we:
- Researched glinty surface rendering problem.
- Familiarized ourselves with Unity HDRP pipeline.
- Implemented first, existing method, Chermain 2020 ([Link to paper.](https://xavierchermain.github.io/real_time_glint)) glinty rendering for punctual lights.


### In the 2023 Winter semester, we:
- Continued research Deliot23, Wang16.
- Implemented Deliot 2023 et.al ([Link to paper.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/real-time-rendering-of-glinty-appearances.html)) glinty rendering method.
- Implemented Zirr 2016 et.al (([Link to paper.](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2016-02_real-time-rendering-procedural-multiscale-materials))) glinty rendering method.
- Devised our own method, that combines the approaches of Deliot and Zirr.
